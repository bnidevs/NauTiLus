## Background
APCS Final Project #2
Our project is a remake of the famous game Dance Dance Revolution. In our game, a user selects a song to which the game presents arrows. The point of the game is to press on the corresponding key when the arrows match up on screen. Points will be determined by how close the arrows are when the user presses the button.
