## Background
APCS Final Project #2
Our project is a remake of the famous game Dance Dance Revolution. In our game, a user selects a song to which the game presents arrows. The point of the game is to press on the corresponding key (WASD) when your arrow matches up to the stationary arrow on screen. Points will be determined by how close the arrows are when the user presses the button. The game ends when the song ends.

## How Does Our Project Work
Our Arrow class contains the basic structure and functionality of a game arrow.
Our game relies on separate processing files for songs (separated by difficulty meaning tempo), credits, and instructions which are all linked the menu.
